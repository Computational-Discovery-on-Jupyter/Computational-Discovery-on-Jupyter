    "What is the oldest method for finding roots of equations?  What is the best way to solve polynomials? Can you solve them analytically? _Is_ there a best way to solve them? How do you solve multivariate polynomials (more than one equation in more than one unknown)? Can you _count_ the number of solutions independently so that you know when you have found them all?  What's the difference between an equation and an identity? Can there be infinitely many solutions to a single equation? (Sure: $\\sin(x)=0$ has solutions $k\\pi$ for any integer $k$) Can an equation have no solutions? (Sure: $\\exp(z) = 0$ has no finite solutions). Can an equation have _accumulation points_ of solutions? (An accumulation point is a place where things pile up infinitely; an example is the set $1/k$ for integers $k$, which has an accumulation point at $0$). Can we solve every polynomial equation in terms of continued fractions? Are there polynomial matrix equations, and can they be solved by Newton's method? What happens with _multiple_ roots, such as $z^2-2z+1=0$? If there are two solutions to an equation, which one is the right one? Can you find a formula for the _integer_ solutions of an equation?  "

    "2: Sometimes Newton iteration is \"too expensive\"; a cheaper alternative is the so-called _secant iteration_, which goes as follows: $z_{n+1} = z_n - f(z_n)(z_{n}-z_{n-1})/(f(z_n) - f(z_{n-1}))$. You need not one, but _two_ initial approximations for this.  Put $f(z) = z^2-2$ and start with the two initial approximations $z_0  = 1$, $z_1 = 3/2$.  Carry out several steps of this (in exact arithmetic is better).  Convert each rational $z_n$ to continued fraction form.  Discuss what you find."

    "3: Try Newton and secant iteration on some functions of your own choosing.  You should see that Newton iteration usually takes fewer iterations to converge, but since it needs a derivative evaluation while the secant method does not, each iteration is \"cheaper\" in terms of computational cost(if $f(z)$ is at all expensive to evaluate, $f'(z)$ usually is too; there are exceptions, of course).  The consensus seems to be that the secant method is a bit more practical; but in some sense it is just a variation on Newton's method."

    "This question doesn't need an _answer_ per se, because there are lots of examples all over the place, but perhaps your solutions need someone to look at them.  Things that can happen: first, and most usual, your code works and the roots get approximated well quite quickly, and the residuals behave something like $r_n = f(z_n) \\approx C r_{n-1}^2$ where $C$ is some constant.  This is usually visible.  If your residuals do _not_ get small quickly, then you might have a bug in your code, or you might have a multiple root.  Sometimes you can divide by zero (if $f'(z)=0$ anywhere near), and sometimes the iteration can go off to infinity or minus infinity (if $f(z) = \\exp(z)$ then it could well go to $-\\infty$)."

    "4: Both the Newton iteration and the secant iteration applied to $f(z) = z^2-a^2$ can be _solved analytically_ by the transformation $z = a\\coth \\theta$.  [Hyperbolic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions)  The iteration $z_{n+1} = (z_n + a^2/z_n)/2$ becomes (you can check this) $\\coth \\theta_{n+1} = \\cosh 2\\theta_n/\\sinh 2\\theta_n = \\coth 2\\theta_n$, and so we may take $\\theta_{n+1} = 2\\theta_n$.  This can be solved to get $\\theta_n = 2^n\\theta_0$ and so we have an analytical formula for each $z_n = a \\coth( 2^n \\theta_0 )$.  Try this on $a^2=2$; you should find that $\\theta_0 = \\mathrm{invcoth}(1/\\sqrt{2})$.  By \"invcoth\" we mean the functional inverse of coth, i.e.: $\\coth\\theta_0 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. It may surprise you that that number is complex.  Nevertheless, you will find that all subsequent iterates are real, and $\\coth 2^n\\theta_0$ goes to $1$ very quickly.\n",

    "NB This was inadvertently difficult.  Neither numpy nor scipy has an invcoth (or arccoth) function. The Digital Library of Mathematical Functions says (equation 4.37.6) that arccoth(z) = arctanh(1/z).  Indeed we had to go to Maple to find out that invcoth$(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\ln(1+\\sqrt{2}) - i\\pi/2$."
