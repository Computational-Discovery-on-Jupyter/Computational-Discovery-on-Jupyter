    "Can we use symbols in continued fractions? Matrices? Can we easily add, multiply, divide continued fractions? Compose them? Can we express known functions as continued fractions? Why aren't continued fractions used more than they are?  Can we visualize them in colour somehow?  Is there any \"continued fraction art\"?  We don't know, but you might look at the [Bridges Math Art website](https://www.bridgesmathart.org/) which is very interesting.\n",

    "Who invented continued fractions first? Or were they invented more than once, in more than one place and time?  [Here's an article from \"Convergence\", a nice open access history journal by the Mathematical Association of America](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/connecting-greek-ladders-and-continued-fractions-history-of-continued-fractions).  We don't really want to _answer_ questions here, just show you some of the ones we thought of; but we find it sort of irresistible. Hey, consider our profession.\n",

    "Are there continued fractions that _don't_ make sense as we let the number of partial quotients go to infinity? (Yes; with some negative entries).  Are continued fractions applied to anything? (a quick googling finds some [gems at Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/585675/what-are-the-applications-of-continued-fractions) only some of which we knew). Then we found [an open-access paper by Carlo Sanna](http://www.rnta.eu/SecondRNTA/Waldschmidt-Sanna.pdf) that has several more.\n",
    "Are there \"continued additions?\"  \"continued multiplications?\" (yes, and yes; called \"infinite series\" and \"infinite products\" respectively; you will likely learn about infinite series in calculus, but infinite products are less commonly seen in courses).  \"continued logarithms?\"  Yes, but only recently; see [work by Jonathan M. Borwein and NJC and others](https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2016.1195307).  Continued exponentials?  Oh, yes! The \"infinite tower of powers\" is a perennial favourite question, and leads to the [Lambert W function](https://orcca.on.ca/LambertW/).  Writing this, RMC is a little surprised that it hasn't been mentioned till now!  "

We'll start using loops in a moment, but right now there are two other puzzles that should appear when you run this program.  First, the pn/qn ratios should be giving the (apparently) same numbers as the xn before, and similarly the difference between squaring the ratio and 2.  But the last two entries give (as a ratio) the _exact_ numbers for `(pn/qn)**2 - 2` (if we have done our algebra right).
