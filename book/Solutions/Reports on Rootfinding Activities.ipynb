[Hyperbolic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions)  The iteration $z_{n+1} = (z_n + a^2/z_n)/2$ becomes (you can check this) $\\coth \\theta_{n+1} = \\cosh 2\\theta_n/\\sinh 2\\theta_n = \\coth 2\\theta_n$, and so we may take $\\theta_{n+1} = 2\\theta_n$.  This can be solved to get $\\theta_n = 2^n\\theta_0$ and so we have an analytical formula for each $z_n = a \\coth( 2^n \\theta_0 )$.  Try this on $a^2=2$; you should find that $\\theta_0 = \\mathrm{invcoth}(1/\\sqrt{2})$.  By \"invcoth\" we mean the functional inverse of coth, i.e.: $\\coth\\theta_0 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. It may surprise you that that number is complex.  Nevertheless, you will find that all subsequent iterates are real, and $\\coth 2^n\\theta_0$ goes to $1$ very quickly.\n",

If we went for a few more iterations, though, we would see the rounding errors take over---this is a case where the iteration _depends sensitively on initial conditions_.
