    "We'll be using Python to explore some interesting mathematics, mathematics not in the standard curriculum.  So it's an opportunity to learn a popular programming language. Why use mathematics, instead of some other science, like biology or physics or chemistry? Why not some engineering, or economics, or psychology, or music?\n",

    "Many of our students, when surveyed, say that they want to be taught \"more programming\" and for it to be taught earlier.  This is an attempt to do so.  Also, we feel that by offering some _interesting_ mathematics straight away, which we can do owing to the powerful tools that we're going to use, we might reach a larger audience for mathematics, and to keep people interested for longer.  Math is useful for a lot of things, although we're not going to focus on that part of it.  Instead we're going straight for the heart of mathematics.\n",
