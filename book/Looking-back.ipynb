    "This book (OER) is _not_ actually completed.  You can add a unit, if you like.  We will likely add some more of our own in future.  But this is a good moment for Zanshin, anyway.  This word also means something like \"follow-through\" and contains an element of maintaining a connection with what you have accomplished.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should look back over the code you have written while engaged with this work of ours.  Was the code well enough documented that you can read it still, some time after you wrote it?  Does it make sense?  If not, then that's a lesson for you about writing intelligible and reusable code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also go back and skim the earlier units.  In Aikido, \"basic movements\" are the foundation of all the techniques, and just because something looks simple doesn't mean it's easy or unimportant.  The \"elementary\" pieces of mathematics and of programming are \"elementary\" not in the sense of \"easy\" but rather in the sense of \"elementary particles\", ie the bits that make up everything. (Thanks to James Davenport at the University of Bath for that simile).\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also look again at some of the harder or open questions that arose.  We are especially puzzled over the connection between continued fractions and Bohemian matrices that we found (invented? manifested?).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that you are more interested in mathematics now than when you started, and are ready for your next mathematical steps.  The process of \"Computational Discovery\" or \"Experimental Mathematics\" is very old, and was practiced by the masters; there is a nice letter of Newton to Leibniz discussing his (Newton's) use of it, for example.  It went out of fashion, but might be coming back into fashion.  Consider [The Polymath Project](https://polymathprojects.org/) for example.  Of course for applied mathematics, computation plays an absolutely essential role; see for instance [the work of the IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for programming, we hope that you are now better prepared for an _actual_ programming course.  There is a lot more to learn there than we have presented.  [Read this paper (again if you have read it already)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) .\n",
