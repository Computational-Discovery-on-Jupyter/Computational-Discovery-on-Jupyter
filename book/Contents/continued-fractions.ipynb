    "This Open Educational Resource (OER) or book uses machine computation _to explore mathematical concepts_ and _to generate questions_. However, we're going to start this unit, as we did the previous unit on Fibonacci numbers, with hand computation and go slow for a while, first. Humour us, for a bit, and think of it as brushing up on arithmetic with fractions.  We will repeat some of our Python introduction, and gradually introduce some more Python as we go.\n",

Soon, we will show a powerful tool (the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](http://oeis.org/) OEIS) which makes this sequence, and many others, accessible. But without either experience or a powerful tool, this sequence is (in our opinion) too difficult to guess just now, because the rule is _nonlinear_."

The program at the server will then suggest that the sequence is [A001601](http://oeis.org/A001601), which indeed it is; look at the next number at that link, which is 665857, the next term above.  One of the rules given at that link (there are several) is indeed how we generated these numbers.  The OEIS is a very powerful kind of index of examples from a wide cross-section of mathematics; it is a professional tool.  Notice that this sequence has _several_ explanations: it occurs in more than one context.  This is part of the power of the OEIS.\n",

    "We expect that you are reading this online.  We expect that you have read/executed the previous unit on Fibonacci numbers before you start on this one (but maybe you are starting here).  The HTML your browser is rendering was produced by a program called Jupyter Book (which you don't need to install, but you can if you want to write your own book).  It worked from \"Jupyter notebooks\" that we wrote, which were connected to a Python 3 \"kernel.\"  We want you to install some version of Python and Jupyter notebooks.  One easy way to do that is to go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/). Follow the download instructions for your particular machine to get the Anaconda distribution.  This includes Jupyter notebooks.  After you have done that, you will be able to launch Jupyter notebooks and run them.  This OER is intended to be for _active_ learning: we want you to experiment, not just read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning__: Jupyter notebooks can't be \"double clicked\" to launch Jupyter Notebook.  You have to start Jupyter Notebook first, [say by the command `jupyter notebook` in an Anaconda prompt](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37993175/difference-between-command-prompt-and-anaconda-prompt) then navigate (yes this means you have to learn the file directory system) to where the notebook is, and open it from within the program.  This seems a bit old-fashioned, but it's just the way things are, and you will get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of our Jupyter notebooks that we told Jupyter Book to use to create this OER are available to you: just click the download button near the top right.  This will give you all our code to experiment with (we have made it available using the MIT license, which, loosely speaking, means you have permission to use it for practically anything, but the code comes with no guarantees and so if something goes wrong with your usage, it's not our fault)."

We don't think you'll need the Python documentation just yet (although the code might look a bit mysterious, its intentions are straightforward), but you can find the [Python 3 documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/) for when you do need it.

That is the graphical interpretation of the inequality that we derived up above.  You can also see the source of our \"could have used calculus\" remark, because it is _the slope of the curve_ (which looks pretty linear on this scale) at $\\sqrt{2}$ that determines the relationship of the horizontal width to the vertical width.  Well, actually, that's kind of the start of _real analysis_; we will leave things at that. "

Then $p_1 = a_1a_0 + 1$ and $q_1 = a_1$.  \"It can be shown that\" \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " p_{n+1} &= a_{n+1}p_n + p_{n-1} \\\\\n",
    " q_{n+1} &= a_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "and this allows us to work _forward_ until we are happy with our approximation.  In the typical unit on continued fractions, one proves that the true answer is _trapped between_ successive convergents, and so the error is less than the difference between two successive convergents. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a mathematical proof, you can find one _very_ clearly written out in Olds' book on pages 21-24. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) has the theorems but not the proofs.  The proof in Olds is by induction, and we do recommend that you try to prove it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you don't want to prove it, you should at least program it.  Here's our program. Once we finished debugging, it successfully computed the value of the list of the partial quotients of the continued fraction for $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Remark on Indexing__ Above we have used $x_0 = p_0/q_0$ to start, indexing from $0$ like Python; Olds uses $x_1 = p_1/q_1$ to start, indexing from $1$ like Maple.  There are a variety of conventions in place, and one must be careful."

    "If one tries to do continued fractions with floating-point arithmetic (e.g. on a calculator) then some \"interesting\" issues arise. Many instructors won't know how to handle them, either&mdash;they're not in any modern calculus book that we know of, just some papers and of course in numerical analysis texts. But if the student is _not_ interested, the facts may seem dull as well as confusing.  Almost no-one likes dealing with rounding error.  See the appendix to this OER!  _In this particular case_ though, there is a uniform [\"shadowing\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowing_lemma) theorem: if one is working in arithmetic with unit roundoff $\\mu$ (for IEEE double precision, $\\mu = 2^{-53} \\approx 10^{-16}$) then the computed $x_k$ from the pass-the-parcel game are the _exact_ $x_k$ for some slightly different starting point $x_0^*$ which differs _at most_ from $x_0$ by $4\\mu$.  There are still subtleties lying around here, because in floating-point, orbits must ultimately be periodic; and by Lagrange's theorem, these can only be from quadratic irrational $x_0$.  These are a set of _measure zero_ in the reals; so we have the paradoxical result that floating-point simulation gives us results that almost surely can't arise if one chooses a true real number $x_0$ \"at random\".  This might be an interesting point of departure for a discussion with the students, but we found that it worked best with the grad students and the other senior students in the class, because it touches on dynamical systems and measure theory.  Indeed, the link above is to some fairly deep mathematics, but for the Gauss map, everything can be constructed explicitly.\n",

We can also (according to our rule, we don't do this, but this time we say that we can) write $2$ as $1+1/1$.  This gives $16/10 = [1;1,1,2] = [1;1,1,1,1]$.  Working backwards, we have \n",

Let's consider it carefully.  We are indexing from zero for the first entry: suppose $x = [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots ]$. Then $x_0 = p_0/q_0 = a_0/1$ is an integer. The next iterate $x_1 = a_0 + 1/a_1$ is a positive quantity larger: $x_0 < x_1$.  But then $x_2 = a_0 + 1/(a_1 + 1/a_2)$ and (because the denominator is _bigger_) $1/(a_1+1/a_2) < 1/a_1$.

So the distance between the two square numbers is $81 - 64 = 9 + 8 = 17$.  Obviously the square root of $73$ must lie between $8$ and $9$. So, think about the number $8$ plus something in between $0$ and $1$ as an approximation to $\\sqrt{73}$; why not $8 + \\frac{9}{17}$?  This is the average distance, in some weird way.  This method has the advantage that it is also $9 - \\frac{8}{17}$ so you get the same answer no matter which end of the interval you start from."

We claim it is impossible to rank people who were clearly smarter than we are. We couldn't even _see_ the differences between them, much less judge them accurately.  And, all of them were rich and privileged in their own ways, and without doubt this list of the \"greatest\" is entirely Eurocentric; where does [Nasir al-Din al-Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi) (who was the academic ancestor of almost every modern mathematics PhD holder, according to the [Mathematics Geneology](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=217509)) fit on this list, or Brahmagupta or Aryabhata or Liu Hui?  Anyway, pointless.  For any list of top ten, one could make a case that Euler belonged there.  His achievements and impact were astounding; one of the \"minor\" things is that he revolutionized mathematical notation and writing, and not just in English---he wrote mostly in Latin.  Reading mathematics before Euler is painful because everyone tried to put things into words; after Euler we are all comfortable reading equations as if they are part of the language, which they _are_.  \n",

    "### Randomness in Continued Fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the \"generic good questions\" in the Preamble was \"What does a random choice look like?\"  For continued fractions, this opens a _huge_ collection of questions.  For instance, if we choose an $x_0$ \"at random\" in the interval $[0,1)$, what does its continued fraction look like?  And what does that even mean, \"look like\"?  A great mathematician, [A. Y. Khinchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Khinchin) (there are about half-a-dozen different ways to transliterate his name to English), solved important problems in this area, and looking at his solutions gives a very good introduction to the deep mathematics known as _ergodic theory_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Quite clearly, in this section we have wandered into topics more suited to the graduate and senior students.  Still, quite a lot of this is an _example_ of the deep theory, and is actually quite accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One answer (Khinchin's answer, with help from Gauss and from Kuzmin) to what continued fractions \"look like\" is to look at a frequency distribution of the partial quotients that arise.  This is related to the distribution of the $x_n$ that arise from the dynamical system $x_n = G(x_{n-1})$ starting from a \"random\" $x_0$; this is an instance of the previously-mentioned ergodic theory.  It turns out the $x_n$ are distributed not uniformly but according to a known distribution, the so-called _Gauss measure_.  We will see more of this in the \"Bohemian matrices\" unit (actually in the solution to one of the exercises).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to partial quotients $a_n$ and their distribution. We've been working with $\\pi$ here, so we know its first few partial quotients: $[3,7,15,1,292,\\ldots]$.  R. William Gosper computed several _million_ partial quotients for $\\pi$ in the 1970s, and nowadays many more are known: see [A001203](http://oeis.org/A001203).  At this time of writing, the record holder is Syed Fahad, with 30 _billion_ partial quotients. Okay, then. So we ought to be able to study the statistics of this particular continued fraction, and in particular we can draw a frequency distribution.  Below, we use only 5000 partial quotients, and drew the resulting frequency distribution.  About 40% of the time, the partial quotient is a $1$.  Next most common is a $2$.  The relative likelihood of a partial quotient appearing seems to diminish with its size.  This is indeed what happens if one chooses $x_0$ \"at random\"; But!\n",
    "\n",
    "_It is not known if the distribution of the partial quotients of $\\pi$_ are \"typical\" (everyone thinks so, but there is no proof). What _is_ known, which Khinchin proved, is that the distribution is the same (the [Gauss–Kuzmin distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss–Kuzmin_distribution)) for _almost all_ initial numbers $x_0$ in the interval (in a technical sense, for a set of measure 1); and that the geometric mean of the partial quotients tends to a constant, now called [Khinchin's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinchin's_constant).\n",

    ":alt: Frequency distribution for five thousand partial quotients of pi\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other kinds of \"random continued fractions\" questions that could be asked.  We invite you to pose some!  We take up this challenge in the exercises for the \"Bohemian Matrices\" unit, where we again see the Gauss&ndash;Kuzmin distribution."

You should read it for Bill's language alone (he still talks like that, and is simply wonderful to be around).

    "0. Open the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and choose a sequence to work with (say, [The Thue--Morse sequence A010060](http://oeis.org/A010060).  Turn it into a continued fraction any way you like (e.g. make a decimal out of the sequence and compute its continued fraction; but do as you please!).  Discover something about that continued fraction. Do not, and we repeat, do not get distracted and explore the OEIS for its own sake.  Really, don't do that. Wait! Stop! Come back!\n",

RMC did this years ago in a now-vanished language (which might come back).

    "5. Does the continued fraction for [Khinchin's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinchin's_constant) follow the Gauss–Kuzmin distribution? It's a pretty puzzle to compute the constant quickly, by the way. See [http://oeis.org/A002210](http://oeis.org/A002210).\n",
