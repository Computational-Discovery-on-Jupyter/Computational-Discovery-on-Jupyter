    "This unit uses some ideas of the late [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot) and some known facts about the so-called _Mandelbrot Set_, together with some of our own ideas, to help you to learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A bit more Python programming, including more practice with the use of _numerical libraries_ from NumPy, _iteration_ and _recursion_; some new things, such as _loop invariants_, _automatic differentiation_, _symbolic computation_, and a bit more about graphics.\n",
    "2. A bit more about polynomials: the _cubic formula_ (we won't need the quartic formula, and even our use of the cubic formula is a bit contrived; but we think it's fun), the _cost of numerical solution of polynomials_ (we will point you to the current numerical champion polynomial solver, [MPSolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPSolve)), and the rather necessary-to-know notions of _numerical stability_ and _conditioning_.  Most of these topics are not taught as thoroughly as they should be, in one's first numerical analysis course; so this material here should strengthen the results when you do encounter them.\n",
    "3. The surprising use of _eigenvalues_ to find roots of polynomials.  The first treatment of eigenvalues (typically in a Linear Algebra course, even though the problem is not, strictly speaking, linear) usually runs the other way around, and defines the eigenvalues of a matrix in terms of the _characteristic polynomial_ of the matrix. Indeed, we will teach you a concept not in the textbooks: namely, the concept of a _minimal height companion matrix_ and we will show you one such for the Mandelbrot polynomials.\n",
    "4. A bit more about _dynamical systems_, especially about _iteration_ and _composition_.\n",
    "5. An excellent approximate formula for the _largest magnitude root_ of the Mandelbrot polynomial.\n",
    "6. An honest-to-goodness analytic solution to the Mandelbrot iteration (this is a very new result, published only in 2021), valid for all $c$ _outside_ the Mandelbrot set.\n",
    "7. That we don't know everything about Mandelbrot polynomials and matrices, and that you might be able to answer some open questions."

There are some open problems here that we believe some students (or you!) may be able to close for us.  At the time of writing, the most itching one is whether or not the Mandelbrot polynomials are unimodal.  This seems like it ought to be easy, but we couldn't do it.\n",

Passing each successive $z_k$ on to the next person to compute $z_{k+1}$ makes the connection with the activity from Continued Fractions.  Indeed, that game could be played with Newton iteration or Halley iteration for rootfinding, and for the iterations used in the Fractals unit.  It's a bit harder to find a \"pass the parcel\" game for Bohemian matrices but it could be done, if you wanted.  In the next unit, on the Chaos Game Representation, there is a better game to play, but it is obviously related to this one.\n",

    "Several important things are going on here: this looks simple, and in one sense it is, but we will see some surprising things from this.  This is an example of a _nonlinear dynamical system_ (perhaps the \"most famous\" example of a nonlinear dynamical system).  We are repeatedly composing the function $f(z) = z^2+c$ with itself: $z_2 = f(c)$ and $z_3 = f(f(c))$ and $z_4 = f(f(f(c))$. Sometimes repeated composition is written with a power in brackets: $f^{(n)}(c)$ means $f(f(f(\\cdots(f(c))\\cdots)))$ where there are $n$ copies of $f$ used; this is where the pernicious notation $f^{(-1)}(c)$ comes from, by the way. We will try to avoid this confusing notation.  Several things can be deduced about repeated composition.  For instance, the result of composing two polynomials together is another polynomial.  If $f(c)$ is of degree $m$ and $g(c)$ is of degree $n$ then $f(g(c))$ is of degree $mn$, and so is $g(f(c))$.  If we were working with non-polynomials then we would also have to worry about matching up the domains and ranges, but polynomials are great because they always give a finite result output for any finite value input, and so composition always works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have written $z_3$ out above as an explicit degree $4$ polynomial (in the variable $c$), but if we actually want to compute a numerical value of $z_3$ given a numerical value for $c$ (say, $c=-1.2$) then it turns out to be better in several ways to just use the iterative formula itself and not the explicit polynomial. This is true even though we could write that explicit polynomial somewhat more efficiently in what is known as [Horner form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method): $z_3 = c\\cdot(1 + c\\cdot(1 + c\\cdot(2 + c)))$, which can be evaluated using only three floating-point multiplications and three floating-point additions. Using the iterative formula directly, though, there is no work to compute $z_0$, there is no floating-point work to compute $z_1 = c$, there is one multiplication and one addition to compute $z_2$, and one more multiplication and one more addition to compute $z_3$, showing that $z_3$ can be computed in only two \"flops\" instead of three.  Note: one \"flop\" is _defined to be_ one floating-point multiplication (or division) together with one floating-point addition (or subtraction).  It's not a fine-tuned measure; it was meant for use in older analyses of the cost of computation.  On modern architectures, the notion is not really all that helpful; but you can see here that no matter what, the cost is less if we use the iteration directly.  This advantage only increases as the iteration proceeds: to compute $z_4$ you only need one more \"flop,\" i.e. $3$ flops, whereas from its polynomial form you need $2^3 = 8$ flops (even ignoring the work that has to be done simply to write the polynomial out).  For $z_{30}(c)$ the iteration takes only 29 flops; but the explicit polynomial is degree $2^{29}$ and would take $2^{29}$ flops to evaluate (actually, it's worse: we would have to use multiple precision to deal with the big integer coefficients).  Thus, somehow, the iteration has _compressed_ a very high degree polynomial into a very efficient box."

Well, putting in a computed root back to the polynomial (assuming it evaluates correctly) gives us a residual, say $r$.  That is $p(c^*) = r$, some (hopefully small) complex number.  But then $c^*$ is the _exact_ root of the following polynomial: $p(c) - r$.  \n",

    "This shows that (at least for $N=8$) solving the (generalized) eigenvalue problem is _much_ more accurate than trying to solve the explicit Mandelbrot polynomial at the same dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it turns out that the matrix method will also (eventually) run into trouble, at about $N=17$ (when RMC's computer tries to store all the zeros in the $d$ by $d$ matrix, and runs out of memory); the dimension of the matrix for $N=14$ is already $16384$ by $16384$, using about sixteen thousand times too much memory, and so this isn't that surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some results of running this code on a 2019 Microsoft Surface Pro (1.3GHz, 4 cores; not that the 4 cores are specially used by Python).  We report the Mandelbrot index, the dimension, the time taken in seconds, and the maximum absolute value of the residual.  We see that in all the cases we get accurate roots, but we also see that as the dimension doubles the cost increases by _more_ than a factor of $2^3=8$, consistently; we do not know why.  We estimated that running this for $N=14$ would take about $3$ hours (it took $2$ hours and $22$ minutes), and would return all roots to about single precision accuracy, which it did (we are working in double precision, of course).  We could use a supposedly faster language (Julia, for instance: except that, ironically, Python seems to be faster for generalized eigenvalues) to speed the computation up, but the _condition number_ of these eigenvalues also seems to be growing; this means the accuracy will diminish.  Another approach seems needed: see MPSolve, and see [Eunice Chan's Master's thesis](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/4028/).  Also, _generalized_ eigenvalue code is (quite a bit!) slower than code for the simple eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$ and we could convert our generalized eigenvalue problem to a simple one by postmultiplying by $\\mathbf{B}^{-1}$ (we can even do that analytically, and this works _very_ well: see the activities) but for now we will step away from the keyboard, happy with accurately computing the roots of the degree $8192$ Mandelbrot polynomial by means of a generalized eigenvalue problem. \n",

    "If we are more careful with memory and use what are known as _sparse_ matrices, then we can go a lot farther.  Using sparse matrices, and special algorithms for finding eigenvalues of sparse matrices, Piers Lawrence was able to take this approach up to about a half a million eigenvalues ($n=19$); it was a bit awkward to make sure that we got all the eigenvalues once and only once, but it worked.  Eunice Chan got up over two million eigenvalues with a different method (homotopy continuation), but the champion is still MPSolve; Dario Bini and Leonard Robol used their software to compute over four million roots of Mandelbrot polynomials.\n",

    "We showed a programmatic method for inheriting types (not actually necessary in the example we used, because adding scalars to `Polynomials` produces a `Polynomial` anyway).  And in the only case where it _would_ matter, it didn't work because Python was lazy about 0 times a Polynomial (it should return a Polynomial with zero coefficients, but just returns a scalar 0).\n",

    "We showed that one can _differentiate a program_ or _take the derivative of a program_ (indeed this can be done by computers as well, in which case it is called \"automatic differentiation\" or \"program differentiation\").  Doing this _efficiently_ is sometimes an issue, but given how tedious differentiation can be, we will take all the help we can get."

Write $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}^{-1}$ and show that the generalized eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda\\mathbf{B}$ are the simple eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}$.  Find $\\mathbf{C}$ for the Mandelbrot matrices above, and code it up and compare the times to compute simple eigenvalues versus generalized eigenvalues. How high a degree can you get to?  We stopped at $N=16$, where the computation took about an hour and a half, and the residual was about $4.0e-5$.  The current record is held by [MPSolve](https://numpi.dm.unipi.it/software/mpsolve) with $k=23$, so over $4$ million roots (using multiple precision); we don't think eigenvalue methods can get that high, but we think [homotopy methods](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/4028/) can (also called \"continuation methods\" as they were in the Rootfinding unit, as a \"really good way to get initial estimates\"), although they haven't yet. {ref}`[Our thoughts] <MandelbrotActivityReport-11>`\n",

Eigenvalues of perturbed matrices are called _pseudospectra_ (the set of eigenvalues themselves is called the _spectrum_).  $\\Lambda_\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{A}) := \\{z : \\exists \\mathbf{E} \\backepsilon \\mathrm{det}(z\\mathbf{I} - (\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{E})) = 0 \\& \\|\\mathbf{E}\\| \\le \\varepsilon\\}$. That definition means, in words, that the pseudospectrum at size $\\varepsilon$ is the set of complex numbers $z$ that are the exact eigenvalues of matrices perturbed by another matrix $\\mathbf{E}$ which is at most $\\varepsilon$ in norm.  Check out the [Pseudospectra gateway](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/pseudospectra/) and then do some pseudospectral experiments with Mandelbrot matrices. {ref}`[Our thoughts] <MandelbrotActivityReport-12>`\n",

Other families of polynomials like the Mandelbrot polynomials can be defined: Fibonacci&ndash;Mandelbrot polynomials defined by $q_{n+1}(z) = z q_n(z) q_{n-1}(z) + 1$ and $q_0(z)=0$ and $q_1(z) = 1$, for instance; or Fibonacci&ndash;Narayana polynomials.  Define your own polynomials by recurrence relation, and find your own matrices whose eigenvalues are their roots, and draw their eigenvalues.  We have only done a few of these, and there are infinitely many to choose from.  It's possible your results will be completely new (and therefore publishable). {ref}`[Our thoughts] <MandelbrotActivityReport-13>`\n",

The paper [Some Facts and Conjectures on Mandelbrot Polynomials](https://doi.org/10.5206/mt.v1i1.14037) contains a formula for the _Mandelbrot Generating Function_ MGF(k,c), which _analytically solves_ the Mandelbrot iteration $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$, at least for $c$ _outside_ the Mandelbrot set.  This means that we could (say) take half an iteration&mdash;and find $z_{1/2}(c)$ or $z_{3/2}(c)$.  As with [Stand-Up Math's Video on Complex Fibonacci Numbers](https://youtu.be/ghxQA3vvhsk) these are likely to be _complex numbers_.  So far as we know, no-one (not even us) has computed these.  Do so, for (say) $c=1$ or $c=2$.  Plot the results.

    "15\\. A [companion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_matrix) for a polynomial (say $P(\\lambda)$) is simply a matrix $C$ whose eigenvalues are the roots of $P(\\lambda)$.  Every matrix has a characteristic polynomial whose roots are its eigenvalues; what's interesting is that this can be run the other way (it's a bit more complicated because \"Frobenius companion matrices\" as in the link above have special properties).  But companion matrices are not unique: any matrix similar to a companion matrix $\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ is also a companion matrix for that same $P(\\lambda)$.  Suppose that you have a polynomial with _integer_ coefficients.  Then the Frobenius companion matrix has (those same) integers as entries, together with ones and zeros.  Therefore, out of all integer companion matrices for $P(\\lambda)$, there must be one with _minimal height_: the height of the matrix is the size of the largest absolute value of any entry in the matrix.  Mandelbrot matrices as defined above have height $1$, which is the smallest possible for integer companions, and are therefore \"minimal height\".  Note that the size of the coefficients of the polynomial are exponential in the degree! So the height of the Frobenius companion matrix of Mandelbrot polynomials is likewise exponential.  Not much is known about [minimal height companion matrices](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11786-018-0364-2) (see also [our first paper](https://journals.uwyo.edu/index.php/ela/article/view/1781)); we do not have an algorithm for finding one for a given integer polynomial, for instance. We _believe_ that minimal height companion matrices are generally better-conditioned as far as their eigenvalues, but we have no proof.  Find a minimal height companion matrix for (say) $\\lambda^3 + 5\\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 1$.  Find a general algorithm for computing minimal height companions.  Prove that they're useful.  If you succeed at this problem, you should certainly publish your results; a good venue might be the [Electronic Journal of Linear Algebra](https://journals.uwyo.edu/index.php/ela). {ref}`[Our thoughts] <MandelbrotActivityReport-15>`\n",
