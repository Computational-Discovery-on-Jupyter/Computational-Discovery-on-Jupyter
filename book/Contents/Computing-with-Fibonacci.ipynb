    "Now that we have defined Fibonacci numbers, and given the connection to $\\phi$ which is called (somewhat mystically) \"The Golden Ratio\" we find that we need to pause and put our \"feet on the ground\".

The tendency to see patterns when they are not there is called [\"pareidolia\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) and we're going to have to guard against this tendency.

If instead we had done `current = next` first, we would have obliterated the value held in the variable `current` before we had a chance to save that value in the variable named `previous`.  This kind of thinking about variables, namely as places to keep values, is important.  This kind of thinking about how to use variables in sequence (putting something in a variable, and then later taking it out and putting it somewhere else) is the essence of programming.  This is _data transfer_ and it is perhaps the most important aspect of computing.  For mathematics, one tends to think that _data transformation_ which is how data can be combined to make new things is even more important, and that is true for mathematics (here we're just using the + operation, but even so we can't do Fibonacci numbers without it) but it is the data transfer aspect that tends to be dominant in other applications.  Even though what we are doing here in this example is so very simple, namely just passing Fibonacci numbers through three variables named `previous`, `current`, and `next`, it's an important action, and worth taking notice of."

    "The above may seem worse than the previous code: three lines of code for each step, but since we are no longer using an explicit naming scheme for our variables, we can use _loops_ to automate things.  To do this we can use `for` or `while` loops.  Again, we are discarding everything older than the previous Fibonacci number; we will revisit this assumption presently.  Loops are written in Python by _indenting_.  Everything that is indented following the `for` or `while` statement will be executed repeatedly, until the conditions for terminating the loop are satisfied. \n",

    "__Remark__ Getting the index correct, so it matches our stated convention, is ridiculously hard for humans to do.  It is pathetically easy to make what is known as an \"off-by-one\" error.  Python's indexing conventions don't appear to help: we seem to start on the right index (2, because `previous = 0` is $F_0$ and `current = 1` is $F_1$ so the first `next` will be $F_2$) but, surprisingly, the range command ends with $6$, meaning that we stop with $F_5$.  Ack.  Perhaps even more disturbingly, if we had not specified the 2 in `range(2,6)` then the index would have started at $0$, not at $1$.  Not all computer languages do this: Matlab and Julia and Maple start at $1$, not $0$, by default, for examples.  But Python follows Edsger W. Dykstra on this: see [the famous memo](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html) if you want an abstract justification. Our job here, though, is not to justify that convention, but simply to get used to it.  It's the language we're using (because it is a popular language), and we are going to use it to do the things that we want to.  We now return you to the Fibonacci numbers.\n",

This kind of loop is a bit more powerful, in that the termination condition does not have to be that the loop executes a fixed number of times.

Sigh.  We wish it was that easy.  The power of `while` loops is quite useful.\n",

    "The following loop executes repeatedly, so long as the variable `i` is less than 31.  The easiest way to make this an infinite loop is to forget to put in a statement that increments `i` every time.  The statement `i+=1` is the same as \"replace the value in `i` with one more than whatever was in `i` before\".  The first time through the loop, `i=2` (as specified before the loop started). So when it gets to that statement, `i` will become 3 and the loop will execute again.  Then 4, then 5, and so on, until the final time the loop gets executed, when `i`=30, then `i=31` will occur, and the loop will stop."

    "The only problem is that it's drawing the wrong spiral&mdash;and we prefer, for very strong reasons, to use radian measure.  However, we'll use degrees in the labels for our plot, too, so that we only change one thing at a time.  The Fibonacci Spiral, which we take from H.S.M. Coxeter's 1969 book Introduction to Geometry, Section 11.3 (pp 164-165 in the PDF we have), suggests that the polar curve\n",

    "r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\phi^{2\\theta/\\pi}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "will nearly have radii equal to the Fibonacci numbers when $\\theta$ is a multiple of $\\pi/2$ radians.  Somewhat confusingly, the formula does not need to be converted to degrees, because the code above actually uses radians (yay!) although the labels (weirdly) are in degrees.  Fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we change the definition of the data for the curve in the above example, to get the code below.  This took some fiddling: at first, we had used a formula using degrees (because the labels confused us); then we had forgotten the square root of 5 in the formula; and then we realized that we didn't need the `ax.set_rlabel_position` command, so we commented it out.  A \"comment character\" is a hash (`#`): Python ignores everything on the line after that character.  Inserting a `#` at the start of the line \"comments out\" the line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a block of comments, one can use `\"\"\"` at the start and again `\"\"\"` at the end to make everything in between into a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we changed the radial axes to be exactly Fibonacci numbers, so you can see that the spiral has radius 3 (visually) when the angle is $2\\pi$ radians or 360 degrees, has radius 5 when the angle is $7\\pi/2$ radians or $360+90 = 450$ degrees, radius 8 when the angle is $3\\pi$ radians or 360+180=540 degrees, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we changed the title command, and voilà."

    "How do we know that plot is correct?  We can check visually where the blue line crosses the inner circles marked $3$, $5$, $8$, and $13$, and see that they do so on horizontal or vertical axes.  We can measure, with a ruler (or dividers or compass!) on the screen, to see if those inner circles are at radii that have the Fibonacci property (is the length marked 13 equal to the sum of the length marked 8 and the length marked 5, for instance).  But we would have been genuinely surprised, unpleasantly so, if something like that went wrong.  We actually did this, after writing this paragraph, and set dividers at the length marked 5, and checked that it was the same length as the distance from the circle marked 8 to the circle marked 13.  Good."

    "Several important things happened in that example.  First, we \"imported\" some extremely useful packages of routines, namely `numpy` (for numerical work, using floating-point arithmetic) and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.  To take square roots, we need numerical routines: the square root function is called `sqrt` but it's in `numpy`.  In our `import` command we decided to use `np` as an abbreviation for `numpy`.  This is common, but we could have used anything (we could have done it in a cursed fashion and \"import numpy as plt\" and \"import matplotlib.pyplot as np\", in fact&mdash;we do _not_ recommend doing this: please keep things to be what you expect them to be!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is _object oriented_ and so the things it deals with typically have _methods_ associated with them. So a \"plot object\" will have an \"axis object\" associated with it&mdash;this was accessed by the command `plt.subplots`.  Thereafter we chose the axis options by calling the methods associated with the `axis` object, which we named `ax` (naturally enough).  This is weird, but you will get used to it, and it has advantages.  Right now, we can just use the syntax by copying and changing and not worrying too much about it."

    "\n",
    "The most important rule of programming is that your bit of code will be re-used sometime.  We took as our starting point for the plot above code that someone _else_ had written: we had to read it, and figure\n",
    "out what it was doing, in order to modify it to produce the plot we wanted.  The comments they included helped a lot, but what helped even more was that the names for the variables aligned with the meaning of the plot.  For mathematics, many of our variables are single letters, for instance $r$ as the radius in a polar plot.  The example code used the letter `r` for the placeholder for the radius values computed in the plot.  The angle is conventionally $\\theta$ in math texts, and the variable (helpfully) was `theta`. The mathematical constant $\\pi$ has the name in Python of `np.pi` which is a bit unexpected, but this \"pi\" lives in the \"numpy\" package which we \"imported as np\" and so (in the Python vernacular) again this makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write your code using variable names that the reader (who _most likely will be you, six months from now_) expects, then the code will be much easier to understand (and debug).  This is actually more important than writing comments for your code, although you should do that, too."

    "We invented a new Fibonacci spiral, using isosceles triangles.  Well, we think it's new.  The Fibonacci literature is _very large_ so we are not _that_ sure it's new.  It was fun, though.  It starts weirdly, with a flat \"isosceles triangle\" with two sides of length 1 and one side of length 2.  This can only be a line segment of length 2 (flat triangle with zero angles).  Next we take a true isosceles triangle with two sides of length 2 and one of length 3 and lay it on the flat triangle.  Then take an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 3 and one of length 5, and fit one of the length 3 sides onto the length 3 side of the previous triangle.  Continue on this way with a (5,5,8) triangle, (8,8,13) triangle, and so on.  Write a Python program to draw these triangles and draw a spiral line through the resulting Fibonacci numbers (starting at 2).\n",

    "There are several useful notions of the _cost_ of a computation.  Perhaps the most important one is the carbon cost: every computation takes energy and how that energy is generated really matters. Floris van der Tak says \"before you ask for time on a facility, first check what kind of power they are using”, in [this 2022 article on carbon cost](https://physicsworld.com/a/the-huge-carbon-footprint-of-large-scale-computing/).  Then there is _opportunity cost_: if you are spending time and compute cycles on this, then you are not spending it on something else (which might be more useful).  This is, of course, spectacularly hard to measure because you have to think of all the other things you could be doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More mundanely, you can think about the cpu time and memory resources that you use on a given machine.  Memory usage is especially complicated nowadays, but at its most basic, how you organize your data can affect the time and energy needed to do your computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're actually not going to worry at all about that, just now.  Instead we are going to think about a variation of opportunity cost, namely \"don't waste time computing things that you don't need, or have already computed\".  This sounds easy enough, but turns out to require serious thinking.  In fact, about _half_ of all speed gains for computation over the last fifty years have come from _algorithmic improvements_ and the other half from hardware improvements.  It turns out that finding the best way to compute something (or even just \"a better way\") is frequently very difficult.  The whole field of \"complexity theory\" studies this using various models.  The _complexity_ of a problem, loosely speaking, is the _minimal cost_ of computing the answer.  For a great many problems&mdash;even for something so simple as matrix multiplication!&mdash;the complexity is not known, although we have many algorithms of varying cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, we need to think about how many steps a program will take, and how long each step will take.  For the function `fibo()` it is easy to see that computing `fibo(n)` will take $n-1$ additions: however, this is not the end of the \n",
    "story, since the summands are increasing in size, and adding large numbers takes longer than adding small numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just to illustrate that, consider $F_{100} = 354224848179261915075$.  Converting this to binary, we get $F_{100} = 100110011001111011011011101101010011111000101100101001011111111000011$.  Counting, we find this has $69$ bits.  Comparing this with $\\log_2(F_{100}) \\approx 68.26 $.  Walking through your memories of how logarithms work, we have $F_{100} = 2^{\\log_2 F_{100}}$ and so it is at least plausible that the number of bits needed to represent $F_{100}$ should be related to $\\log_2 F_{100}$. \n",

We need _both_ those two.  We could also (if we liked) check the special case $n=2$ and return that, but that case can be covered by the general rule $F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}$ and to keep the code short we only code the necessary special cases."

If during that execution it encounters another instance of the recursive routine, it makes a new copy of everything it needs (which is usually different than from before) and puts it on the stack (on top) and tries to execute _that_, and so on.  When it finally succeeds (with one of the \"obvious\" ones) it \"pops the stack\" and returns to executing the previous one, and so on.

Even if a variable outside the procedure has the name `next`, that label points to a different box.  This is a good thing, and prevents the variables inside the procedure from obliterating variables used outside the procedure.  Sometimes you might think you want a variable that _is_ visible outside the procedure, however, and the above code shows you how to do that.  In practice, this is generally discouraged: global variables should be used very sparingly, if at all.

    "This turns out to be a general fact: the sequence $F_k$ mod $m$ for any fixed integer $m$ is indeed periodic.  Its period is called the _Pisano period_ (sometimes the \"Fibonacci period\"; some of us wondered who \"Pisano\" was, and felt silly when we realised it was just Leonardo of Pisa or Leonardo Pisano and not another mathematician named \"Pisano\"!).  Sometimes the Pisano period is written as $\\pi(m)$ using the Greek letter $\\pi$, but this risks confusion with the use of $\\pi(x)$ to mean the number of primes less than $x$, or indeed confusion with the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no simple rule known for computing the [Pisano period](https://oeis.org/A001175).  We find the Wikipedia article on this to be difficult to read (perhaps this is because it currently contains errors).  We recommend instead [Eric Weisstein's piece on MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PisanoPeriod.html) which contains, among others, the interesting fact that modulo $m = 10^d$, that is, looking at the last $d$ digits, the Pisano period is known to be $15\\cdot 10^{d-1}$.  So, for the final $100$ digits, the Pisano period is $15\\cdot 10^{99}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, working mod $m=10^d$, we \"only\" have to compute $15\\cdot 10^{99}$ values of $F_k$, and thereafter it repeats. So, to find $F_{n}$ mod $m$, we only have to find where $n$ lies in the cycle&mdash;that is, compute $n$ mod $15\\cdot 10^{99}$.  Both of these are (relatively) easy.  Maple says that $7^{12345678}$ mod $15\\cdot 10^{99}$ is $10074958745783517956561868690867278026860583978054601497639995184130970247153466763696198800985914449$ (it took only a few seconds to do this).  By writing some more Python code, we were able to confirm this independently.  The last $100$ digits of the Fibonacci number with this index can be computed in less than $0.004$ seconds (on this machine): we get $F_{7^{12345678}}$ mod $10^{100}$ to be $307317414528301264423288910092883733560870958520339896436368099936463847448493468403352592709652449$.  We used the program `FibonacciByDoublingModM` shown in the Reports.\n",

    "Now, is this correct?  How could we tell?  It's difficult to be _sure_ because all of our verifications will be by other computations; but there are ways.  We could look at it mod $10$, for instance, or $10^{10}$, where the answer is a reassuring $2709652449$.  So at least our method and code is consistent!\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting side note: we thought for a while that we had identified a problem in Python's built-in modular arithmetic, for very large inputs.  See the Reports.  Although we figured out what was happening (the % operator needs parentheses) this raises the disquieting possibility that some other piece of the code that we rely on is actually flawed, and makes us want to have independent means of checking the answers."

While he probably did not see any work of [Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala), the 3rd century BCD Sanskrit scholar who arguably did the first work on what we know now as Fibonacci sequences, it is not beyond possibility that Leonard of Pisa _did_ see work of the 10th century scholar [Halayudha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halayudha), or at least some derivatives of that work (this is speculation on our part: we have license, we are not historians).  There would have been time (some two hundred years) for this work to diffuse in the rich Islamic scholarly world of the time.  This is suggestive, therefore, that Leonard of Pisa doesn't deserve all the credit for Fibonacci numbers.  The [link at the OEIS](https://oeis.org/A000045), also gives credit to [Hemachandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemachandra#Mathematics).\n",
    "\n",
    "What Fibonacci _did_ do was a great service to European mathematics, science, engineering, and industry: he introduced the Indian system of notation and systems of arithmetic to Europe in his justifiably famous book _Liber Abaci_.  According to the MacTutor article linked above, he also did some deeper mathematics of his own (genuinely his own) and published that in a more \"serious\" book, _Liber quadratorum_ and achieved some fame amongst the learned thereby (and by solving some \"challenge\" problems set by a scientist in the court of Fredrick II).  Much of this more serious work was forgotten, and rediscovered some three hundred years later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"Fibonacci numbers\" is not going to be changed.  There's simply too many pieces of paper in the world with that name attached to them.  It's never going to go away.  We hope, though, that the true historical depth of this interesting sequence can at least be acknowledged."

It looks kind of redundant and useless, because we see that the $b_n$'s are really Fibonacci numbers themselves (indeed $b_n = F_n$).  One can then notice that the $a_n$s are also solutions of the Fibonacci recurrence relation, that is $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$, but with different initial conditions: $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 1$. That is, the $a_n$ are the [Lucas numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number) $L_n$. Then we notice that it seems to show that $F_{-n} = (-1)^{n-1} F_n$ is a consistent definition (consistent with Binet's formula, which also gives $F_{-n} = (-1)^{n-1}F_n$) of Fibonacci numbers of negative index, and so we might wonder further what a Fibonacci number of _real_ or even _complex_ index might look like.

    "The first time this class was run at Western, we enrolled first year students and _graduate students_ (typically PhD students, with some Masters' students, and a couple of seniors as well) in the same classroom.  These more advanced students got an extra class a week, which was used for an actual lecture (they were, after all, used to lectures).  They also got several activities to choose from which relied more heavily on advanced topics; not only calculus and linear algebra and differential equations, but occasionally analysis and numerical analysis and dynamical systems as well.

Just a function like $0 + 1\\cdot z + 1\\cdot z^2 + 2 \\cdot z^3 + \\cdots + 89 \\cdot z^{11} + O(z^{12})$ where the \"O\" symbol means that there are more terms afterwards, but we truncate there and don't print them (or even think about them).  These are _like_ polynomials in many ways, but they are not polynomials; and in particular when you multiply two TPS together you ignore any terms that would be truncated.\n",

Look up the language [FORMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORMAC) invented by [Jean Sammet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_E._Sammet), for instance. And do read her biography, too.  Modern computer algebra systems usually have better methods, which respect sparsity.  But let's do it old school.\n",
