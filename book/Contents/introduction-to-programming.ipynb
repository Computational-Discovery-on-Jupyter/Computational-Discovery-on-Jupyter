    "and two initial conditions.  There are several different conventions about what the initial \n",

    "The only problem is that it's drawing the wrong spiral&mdash;and we prefer, for very strong reasons, to use radian measure.  However, we'll use degrees in the labels for our plot, too, so that we only change one thing at a time.  The Fibonacci Spiral, which we take from H.S.M. Coxeter's 1969 book Introduction to Geometry, Section 11.3 (pp 164-165 in the PDF we have), suggests that the polar curve\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\phi^{2\\theta/\\pi}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "will nearly have radii equal to the Fibonacci numbers when $\\theta$ is a multiple of $\\pi/2$ radians.  Somewhat confusingly, the formula does not need to be converted to degrees, because the code above actually uses radians (yay!) although the labels (weirdly) are in degrees.  Fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we change the definition of the data for the curve in the above example, to get the code below.  This took some fiddling: at first, we had used a formula using degrees (because the labels confused us); then we had forgotten the square root of 5 in the formula; and then we realized that we didn't need the \"ax.set_rlabel_position\" command, so we commented it out.  A \"comment character\" is a # at the start of the line: Python ignores everything after that character.  Then we changed the radial axes to be exactly Fibonacci numbers, so you can see that the spiral has radius 3 (visually) when the angle is $2\\pi$ radians or 360 degrees, has radius 5 when the angle is $7\\pi/2$ radians or $360+90 = 450$ degrees, radius 8 when the angle is $3\\pi$ radians or 360+180=540 degrees, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we changed the title command, and voilá."

    "Several important things happened in that example.  First, we \"imported\" some extremely useful packages of routines, namely \"numpy\" (for numerical work, using floating-point arithmetic) and \"matplotlib.pyplot\" for plotting.  To take square roots, we need numerical routines: the square root function is called \"sqrt\" but it's in numpy.  In our import command we decided to use \"np\" as an abbreviation for numpy.  This is common, but we could have used anything (we could have done it in a cursed fashion and \"import numpy as plt\" and \"import matplotlib.pyplot as np\", in fact---we do _not_ recommend doing this: please keep things to be what you expect them to be!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is _object oriented_ and so the things it deals with typically have _methods_ associated with them. So a \"plot object\" will have an \"axis object\" associated with it---this was accessed by the command plt.subplots.  Thereafter we chose the axis options by calling the methods associated with the axis object, which we named \"ax\" (naturally enough).  This is weird, but you will get used to it, and it has advantages.  Right now, we can just use the syntax by copying and changing and not worrying too much about it."

    "There are several useful notions of the _cost_ of a computation.  Perhaps the most important one is the carbon cost: every computation takes energy and how that energy is generated really matters. Floris van der Tak says \"before you ask for time on a facility, first check what kind of power they are using”, in [this 2022 article on carbon cost](https://physicsworld.com/a/the-huge-carbon-footprint-of-large-scale-computing/).  Then there is _opportunity cost_: if you are spending time and compute cycles on this, then you are not spending it on something else (which might be more useful).  This is, of course, spectacularly hard to measure because you have to think of all the other things you could be doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More mundanely, you can think about the cpu time and memory resources that you use on a given machine.  Memory usage is especially complicated nowadays, but at its most basic, how you organize your data can affect the time and energy needed to do your computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're actually not going to worry at all about that, just now.  Instead we are going to think about a variation of opportunity cost, namely \"don't waste time computing things that you don't need, or have already computed\".  This sounds easy enough, but turns out to require serious thinking.  In fact, about _half_ of all speed gains for computation over the last fifty years have come from _algorithmic improvements_ and the other half from hardware improvements.  It turns out that finding the best way to compute something (or even just \"a better way\") is frequently very difficult.  The whole field of \"complexity theory\" studies this using various models.  The _complexity_ of a problem, loosely speaking, is the _minimal cost_ of computing the answer.  For a great many problems---even for something so simple as matrix multiplication!---the complexity is not known, although we have many algorithms of varying cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, we need to think about how many steps a program will take, and how long each step will take.  For the function `fibo()` it is easy to see that computing `fibo(n)` will take $n-1$ additions: however, this is not the end of the \n",

It looks kind of redundant and useless, because we see that the $b_n$'s are really Fibonacci numbers themselves (indeed $b_n = F_n$).  One can then notice that the $a_n$s are also solutions of the Fibonacci recurrence relation, that is $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$, but with different initial conditions: $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 1$.  Then we notice that it seems to show that $F_{-n} = (-1)^{n-1} F_n$ is a consistent definition (consistent with Binet's formula, which also gives $F_{-n} = (-1)^{n-1}F_n$) of Fibonacci numbers of negative index, and so we might wonder further what a Fibonacci number of _complex_ index might look like.
