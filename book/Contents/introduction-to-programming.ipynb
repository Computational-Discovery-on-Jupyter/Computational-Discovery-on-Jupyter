If instead we had done \"current = next\" first, we would have obliterated the value held in the variable \"current\" before we had a chance to save that value in the variable named \"previous\".  This kind of thinking about variables, namely as places to keep values, is important.  This kind of thinking about how to use variables in sequence (putting something in a variable, and then later taking it out and putting it somewhere else) is the essence of programming.  This is _data transfer_ and it is perhaps the most important aspect of computing.  For mathematics, one tends to think that _data transformation_ which is how data can be combined to make new things is even more important, and that is true for mathematics (here we're just using the + operation, but even so we can't do Fibonacci numbers without it) but it is the data transfer aspect that tends to be dominant in other applications.  Even though what we are doing here in this example is so very simple, namely just passing Fibonacci numbers through three variables named \"previous\", \"current\", and \"next\", it's an important action, and worth taking notice of."

    "__Remark__ Getting the index correct, so it matches our stated convention, is ridiculously hard for humans to do.  It is pathetically easy to make what is known as an \"off-by-one\" error.  Python's indexing conventions don't appear to help: we seem to start on the right index (2, because previous = 0 is $F_0$ and current = 1 is $F_1$ so the first \"next\" will be $F_2$) but, surprisingly, the range command ends with $6$, meaning that we stop with $F_5$.  Ack.  Perhaps even more disturbingly, if we had not specified the 2 in range(2,6) then the index would have started at $0$, not at $1$.  Not all computer languages do this: Matlab and Julia and Maple start at $1$, not $0$, by default, for examples.  But Python follows Edsger W. Dykstra on this: see [the famous memo](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html) if you want an abstract justification. Our job here, though, is not to justify that convention, but simply to get used to it.

    "Somehow, that list is redundant.  If the list were simply [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55] it would contain essentially the same information, because that first entry of each pair in the previous list is just its index: fib_list[0] is [0,0] and fib_list[k] would be [k,$F_k$].  So if you know that when you ask for the $k$th entry you will get k back as the first element, it seems that you are being told something you already know.  Nonetheless, redundancy is sometimes useful, and there will be times when you want a list of two elements and the first element is where the original pair occurred.\n",

The [Lucas_ numbers](https://oeis.org/A000032) $L_n$ are defined by the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, namely $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$, but use different initial conditions: $L_0 = 2$, and $L_1 = 1$.  Write a \"for\" loop in Python to compute the Lucas numbers up to $L_{30}$.  Compare your answers with the numbers given at the OEIS entry linked above (A000032).\n",

    "We will see lots of plots later on, but right now what we want to do is draw a _polar plot_ which we (the authors) actually haven't done up until now in Python, so we will demonstrate not only how to do it, but how we learned how to do it.  Naturally, the answer involves Professor Google.  We entered \"draw polar plot in Python\" in our browser, and looked at the results.  The top hit was a video (which we did not look at) and the second hit was to the [\"matplotlib\" documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_demo.html).  This package, matplotlib, is going to be very useful for us, and so we go ahead and do this.\n",

    "The only problem is that it's drawing the wrong spiral&mdash;and we prefer, for very strong reasons, to use radian measure.  However, we'll use degrees in the labels for our plot, too, so that we only change one thing at a time.  The Fibonacci Spiral, which we take from H.S.M. Coxeter's 1969 book Introduction to Geometry, Section 11.3 (pp 164-165 in the PDF we have), suggests that the polar curve\n",

    "will nearly have radii equal to the Fibonacci numbers when $\\theta$ is a multiple of $\\pi/2$ radians.  Somewhat confusingly, the formula does not need to be converted to degrees, because the code above actually uses radians (yay!) although the labels (weirdly) are in degrees.  Fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we change the definition of the data for the curve in the above example, to get the code below.  This took some fiddling: at first, we had used a formula using degrees (because the labels confused us); then we had forgotten the square root of 5 in the formula; and then we realized that we didn't need the `ax.set_rlabel_position` command, so we commented it out.  A \"comment character\" is a # at the start of the line: Python ignores everything on the line after that character.  Then we changed the radial axes to be exactly Fibonacci numbers, so you can see that the spiral has radius 3 (visually) when the angle is $2\\pi$ radians or 360 degrees, has radius 5 when the angle is $7\\pi/2$ radians or $360+90 = 450$ degrees, radius 8 when the angle is $3\\pi$ radians or 360+180=540 degrees, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we changed the title command, and voilá."

    "Several important things happened in that example.  First, we \"imported\" some extremely useful packages of routines, namely \"numpy\" (for numerical work, using floating-point arithmetic) and \"matplotlib.pyplot\" for plotting.  To take square roots, we need numerical routines: the square root function is called \"sqrt\" but it's in numpy.  In our import command we decided to use \"np\" as an abbreviation for numpy.  This is common, but we could have used anything (we could have done it in a cursed fashion and \"import numpy as plt\" and \"import matplotlib.pyplot as np\", in fact&mdash;we do _not_ recommend doing this: please keep things to be what you expect them to be!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is _object oriented_ and so the things it deals with typically have _methods_ associated with them. So a \"plot object\" will have an \"axis object\" associated with it&mdash;this was accessed by the command plt.subplots.  Thereafter we chose the axis options by calling the methods associated with the axis object, which we named `ax` (naturally enough).  This is weird, but you will get used to it, and it has advantages.  Right now, we can just use the syntax by copying and changing and not worrying too much about it."

    "### Self-documenting code and comments\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important rule of programming is that your bit of code will be re-used sometime.  We took as our starting point for the plot above code that someone _else_ had written: we had to read it, and figure\n",
    "out what it was doing, in order to modify it to produce the plot we wanted.  The comments they included helped a lot, but what helped even more was that the names for the variables aligned with the meaning of the plot.  For mathematics, many of our variables are single letters, for instance $r$ as the radius in a polar plot.  The example code used the letter \"r\" for the placeholder for the radius values computed in the plot.  The angle is conventionally $\\theta$ in math texts, and the variable (helpfully) was \"theta\". The mathematical constant $\\pi$ has the name in Python of \"np.pi\" which is a bit unexpected, but this \"pi\" lives in the \"numpy\" package which we \"imported as np\" and so (in the Python vernacular) again this makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write your code using variable names that the reader (which _most likely will be you, six months from now_) expects, then the code will be much easier to understand (and debug).  This is actually more important than writing comments for your code, although you should do that, too."

    "#### Exercises\n",
    "1. Write Python code to [draw the traditional Fibonacci Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral).  This starts with a square of side 1, then another square of side 1 adjacent to it; then a square of side 2 adjacent to those two squares.  Then a square of side 3 adjacent to the square of side 2 and the two squares of side 1 (there are two ways to do this, but both work).  Then a square of side 5 adjacent to the square of side 3 and the squares of side 1; there is only one way to do this now that you made your previous choice. Then a square of side 8 adjacent to the squares of side 5, 1, and 2; then a square of side 13 adjacent to the squares of side 8, 2, and 3, and so on, spiralling ever larger.  Then, if you like, you can draw quarter-arcs of circles in each square to make a spiralling line.\n",
    "2. We invented a new Fibonacci spiral, using isosceles triangles.  Well, we think it's new.  The Fibonacci literature is _very large_ so we are not at all sure it's new.  It was fun, though.  It starts weirdly, with a flat \"isosceles triangle\" with two sides of length 1 and one side of length 2.  This can only be a line segment of length 2 (flat triangle with zero angles).  Next we take a true isosceles triangle with two sides of length 2 and one of length 3 and lay it on the flat triangle.  Then take an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 3 and one of length 5, and fit one of the length 3 sides onto the length 3 side of the previous triangle.  Continue on this way with a (5,5,8) triangle, (8,8,13) triangle, and so on.  Write a Python program to draw these triangles and draw a spiral line through the resulting Fibonacci numbers (starting at 2).\n",
    "3. Do something arty, new, and fun with a Fibonacci image.  There's lots of fun inspiration on Etsy, for example, but feel free to be inventive (we feel that our solution to the previous problem satisfies this request, as well, so we won't put another into the \"Solutions\")."

    "There are several useful notions of the _cost_ of a computation.  Perhaps the most important one is the carbon cost: every computation takes energy and how that energy is generated really matters. Floris van der Tak says \"before you ask for time on a facility, first check what kind of power they are using”, in [this 2022 article on carbon cost](https://physicsworld.com/a/the-huge-carbon-footprint-of-large-scale-computing/).  Then there is _opportunity cost_: if you are spending time and compute cycles on this, then you are not spending it on something else (which might be more useful).  This is, of course, spectacularly hard to measure because you have to think of all the other things you could be doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More mundanely, you can think about the cpu time and memory resources that you use on a given machine.  Memory usage is especially complicated nowadays, but at its most basic, how you organize your data can affect the time and energy needed to do your computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're actually not going to worry at all about that, just now.  Instead we are going to think about a variation of opportunity cost, namely \"don't waste time computing things that you don't need, or have already computed\".  This sounds easy enough, but turns out to require serious thinking.  In fact, about _half_ of all speed gains for computation over the last fifty years have come from _algorithmic improvements_ and the other half from hardware improvements.  It turns out that finding the best way to compute something (or even just \"a better way\") is frequently very difficult.  The whole field of \"complexity theory\" studies this using various models.  The _complexity_ of a problem, loosely speaking, is the _minimal cost_ of computing the answer.  For a great many problems&mdash;even for something so simple as matrix multiplication!&mdash;the complexity is not known, although we have many algorithms of varying cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, we need to think about how many steps a program will take, and how long each step will take.  For the function `fibo()` it is easy to see that computing `fibo(n)` will take $n-1$ additions: however, this is not the end of the \n",

Counting, we find this has $69$ bits.  Comparing this with $\\log_2(F_{100}) \\approx 68.26 $.  Walking through your memories of how logarithms work, we have $F_{100} = 2^{\\log_2 F_{100}}$ and so it is at least plausible that the number of bits needed to represent $F_{100}$ should be related to $\\log_2 F_{100}$. \n",

    "We can sometimes write simpler code if we use the idea of recursion.  Let's define a function `fibor(n)` which will recursively call `fibor(n-1)` and `fibor(n-2)`.  The name `fibor` was chosen so that it is short, and the \"r\" is meant to recall \"recursion\".  Python doesn't care about names of things, so long as they are unique: choosing _good_ names is a kind of documentation for humans.  We are not being overly fussy about program names just now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Remark about Recursion for Students encountering it for the First Time.\n",
    "Some people (but by no means all!) find recursion to be a very natural idea: to solve a problem, replace it with some smaller but otherwise identical problems and solve those.  Doing this recursively means solving each of those smaller problems by replacing _them_ with some even smaller but otherwise identical problems, and so on until the problems get small enough that the solution is obvious and we just return those obvious solutions instead of breaking them up even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning those \"obvious\" solutions for the \"small enough\" cases is called the _base of the recursion_ and without it, recursion doesn't work (and just gives you an infinite loop, sometimes).  So we often code the base of the recursion first.  For Fibonacci numbers, the base of the recursion is the starting values: when $n=0$, $F_n = F_0 = 0$, and when $n=1$, $F_n = F_1 = 1$.  We need _both_ those two.  We could also (if we liked) check the special case $n=2$ and return that, but that case can be covered by the general rule $F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}$ and to keep the code short we only code the necessary special cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How this is done by the computer (first mention of the word \"stack\")\n",
    "Recursion is implemented in differing ways, but one way to think about it that models these different ways well enough to get the idea is that every time the interpreter encounters a call to the function it _makes a copy_ of everything it needs and puts it in a convenient place, the __stack__, and tries to execute it.  If during that execution it encounters another instance of the recursive routine, it makes a new copy of everything it needs (which is usually different than from before) and puts it on the stack (on top) and tries to execute _that_, and so on.  When it finally succeeds (with one of the \"obvious\" ones) it \"pops the stack\" and returns to executing the previous one, and so on.  We only mention this here because Python has only a finite stack, and it is possible to run out of memory doing things this way."

This is a good thing, and prevents the variables inside the procedure from obliterating variables used outside the procedure.  Sometimes you might think you want a variable that _is_ visible outside the procedure, however, and the above code shows you how to do that.  In practice, this is generally discouraged: global variables should be used very sparingly, if at all.

This is one way to understand how Maple computes Fibonacci numbers.  [See Jürgen Gerhard's article on the subject](https://doi.org/10.5206/mt.v1i1.14038).  Turning those identities into a usable recurrence relation requires some more effort, though, and takes us a bit away from our main point.

Now the size of the output (and of the intermediate computations) is kept small, and the limiting factor is the number of squarings of matrices we are going to perform.  Consequently it is now feasible to take something like $n=7^{12345678}$, a number which has more than 10 million decimal digits, and compute (say) the \n",
    "final 100 digits of $F_n$. Note that $F_n$ has about $0.6942 \\cdot 7^{12345678} \\approx 0.7 \\cdot 10^{10^7}$ bits and just to store it would take more computer memory than exists in this world. So we have to \"box clever\".\n",

    "### Pisano periods\n",
    "We begin with a simple observation: the sequence of Fibonacci numbers $0$, $1$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $\\ldots$ is even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, $\\ldots$ and it has to be so: add an even to an odd number, you get an odd number; add two odds, you get an even; and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Put in terms of _modular arithmetic_, the sequence $F_k$ mod $2$ (ie the sequence of remainders on division by $2$) is _periodic_ with period $3$.  Now let's look at the sequence $F_k$ mod $3$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, \\ldots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which has period $8$.  The sequence $F_k$ mod $4$ has period $6$.  The sequence $F_k$ mod $5$ has period $20$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be a general fact: the sequence $F_k$ mod $m$ for any fixed integer $m$ is indeed periodic.  Its period is called the _Pisano period_ (sometimes the \"Fibonacci period\").  Sometimes it is written as $\\pi(m)$ using the Greek letter $\\pi$, but this risks confusion with the use of $\\pi(x)$ to mean the number of primes less than $x$, or indeed confusion with the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no simple rule known for computing the [Pisano period](https://oeis.org/A001175).  We find the Wikipedia article on this to be difficult to read (and perhaps this is because it currently contains errors).  We recommend instead [Eric Weisstein's piece on MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PisanoPeriod.html) which contains, among others, the interesting fact that modulo $m = 10^d$, that is, looking at the last $d$ digits, the Pisano period is known to be $15\\cdot 10^{d-1}$.  So, for the final $100$ digits, the Pisano period is $15\\cdot 10^{99}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, working mod $m=10^d$, we \"only\" have to compute $15\\cdot 10^{99}$ values of $F_k$, and thereafter it repeats. So, to find $F_{n}$ mod $m$, we only have to find where $n$ lies in the cycle&mdash;that is, compute $n$ mod $15\\cdot 10^{99}$.  Both of these are (relatively) easy.  Maple says that $7^{12345678}$ mod $15\\cdot 10^{99}$ is $10074958745783517956561868690867278026860583978054601497639995184130970247153466763696198800985914449$ (it took only a few seconds to do this).  By writing some more Python code, we were able to confirm this independently.  The last $100$ digits of the Fibonacci number with this index can be computed in less than $0.004$ seconds (on this machine): we get $F_{7^{12345678}}$ mod $10^{100}$ to be $307317414528301264423288910092883733560870958520339896436368099936463847448493468403352592709652449$.  We used the program `FibonacciByDoublingModM` shown in the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, is this correct?  How could we tell?  It's difficult to be _sure_ because all of our verifications will be by other computations; but there are ways.  We could look at it mod $10$, for instance, or $10^{10}$, where the answer is a reassuring $2709652449$.  So at least our method and code is consistent!\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting side note: we seem to have identified a problem in Python's built-in modular arithmetic, for very large inputs.  See the Solutions.  This raises the disquieting possibility that some other piece of the code that we rely on is actually flawed, and makes us want to have independent means of checking the answers."

    "Most mathematicians are poor historians, even of mathematics.  Typically they take at most one course in the History of Mathematics (and maybe never give any courses, which would be better training for them).  We do not claim to be historians of mathematics here, and we will give only a sketch in any case, and point you to better sources.  We take much of what we say below from [The MacTutor entry for Fibonacci](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fibonacci/). We understand that true historians of mathematics are not very enthused about that source, but we have found it useful.\n",

    "From it we learn that Leonardo of Pisa (apparently his proper name: \"Fibonacci\" is only a nickname) was born, probably in Pisa, in 1170CE and died in 1250CE, probably in Pisa, aged about 80.  He travelled quite extensively, doing significant work in what is now Algeria.  It was there that he was exposed to Indian mathematics, as transmitted by generations of Islamic scholars.  While he probably did not see any work of [Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala), the 3rd century BCD Sanskrit scholar who arguably did the first work on what we know now as Fibonacci sequences, it is not beyond possibility that Leonard of Pisa _did_ see work of the 10th century scholar [Halayudha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halayudha), or at least some derivatives of that work (this is speculation on our part: we have license, we are not historians).  There would have been time (some two hundred years) for this work to diffuse in the rich Islamic scholarly world of the time.  This is suggestive, therefore, that Leonard of Pisa doesn't deserve all the credit for Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "What he _did_ do was a great service to European mathematics, science, engineering, and industry: he introduced the Indian system of notation and systems of arithmetic to Europe in his justifiably famous book _Liber Abaci_.  According to the MacTutor article linked above, he also did some deeper mathematics of his own (genuinely his own) and published that in a more \"serious\" book, _Liber quadratorum_ and achieved some fame amongst the learned thereby (and by solving some \"challenge\" problems set by a scientist in the court of Fredrick II).  Much of this more serious work was forgotten, and rediscovered some three hundred years later.\n",

    "The name \"Fibonacci numbers\" is not going to be changed.  There's simply too many pieces of paper in the world with that name attached to them.  It's never going to go away.  We hope, though, that the true historical depth of this interesting sequence can at least be acknowledged."

    "This looks like just a simple set of arithmetic computations.  It looks kind of redundant and useless, because we see that the $b_n$'s are really Fibonacci numbers themselves (indeed $b_n = F_n$).  One can then notice that the $a_n$s are also solutions of the Fibonacci recurrence relation, that is $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$, but with different initial conditions: $a_0 = 2$ and $a_1 = 1$. That is, the $a_n$ are the Lucas numbers $L_n$. Then we notice that it seems to show that $F_{-n} = (-1)^{n-1} F_n$ is a consistent definition (consistent with Binet's formula, which also gives $F_{-n} = (-1)^{n-1}F_n$) of Fibonacci numbers of negative index, and so we might wonder further what a Fibonacci number of _real_ or even _complex_ index might look like.
