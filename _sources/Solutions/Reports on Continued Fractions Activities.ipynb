This says that `x5` squared is only about -4.4 times ten to the minus 16 smaller than 2 (we will see in a moment that this is not a very trustworthy statement).  That is, Python says that `x5` is the exact square root of a number only a proton's width away from two (see the appendix on floating point numbers)."

    "Can we use symbols in continued fractions? Matrices? Can we easily add, multiply, divide continued fractions? Compose them? Can we express known functions as continued fractions? Why aren't continued fractions used more than they are?  Can we visualize them in colour somehow?  Is there any \"continued fraction art\"?  We don't know, but you might look at the [Bridges Math Art website](https://www.bridgesmathart.org/) which is very interesting.\n",

    "Who invented continued fractions first? Or were they invented more than once, in more than one place and time?  [Here's an article from \"Convergence\", a nice open access history journal by the Mathematical Association of America](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/connecting-greek-ladders-and-continued-fractions-history-of-continued-fractions).  We don't really want to _answer_ questions here, just show you some of the ones we thought of; but we find it sort of irresistible. Hey, consider our profession.\n",

    "Are there continued fractions that _don't_ make sense as we let the number of partial quotients go to infinity? (Yes; with some negative entries).  Are continued fractions applied to anything? (a quick googling finds some [gems at Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/585675/what-are-the-applications-of-continued-fractions) only some of which we knew). Then we found [an open-access paper by Carlo Sanna](http://www.rnta.eu/SecondRNTA/Waldschmidt-Sanna.pdf) that has several more.\n",
    "Are there \"continued additions?\"  \"continued multiplications?\" (yes, and yes; called \"infinite series\" and \"infinite products\" respectively; you will likely learn about infinite series in calculus, but infinite products are less commonly seen in courses).  \"continued logarithms?\"  Yes, but only recently; see [work by Jonathan M. Borwein and NJC and others](https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2016.1195307).  Continued exponentials?  Oh, yes! The \"infinite tower of powers\" is a perennial favourite question, and leads to the [Lambert W function](https://orcca.on.ca/LambertW/).  Writing this, RMC is a little surprised that it hasn't been mentioned till now!  "

    "The high-school \"blending\" formula is less accurate&mdash;if one uses the $a + b/(2a)$ formula to best advantage, that is.  Here, if we don't think about using $81$ instead of $64$, the high-school method is a bit better: $8+9/17 = 145/17 \\approx 8.5294$; when squared, this is $72.7508$, just a bit bigger than $72.75$.  Now, if we use $73 = 64 + 9$ we get $8 + 9/16 = 8.5625$, which, when squared, gives $73.3164$, which is worse than the blending formula (being too big by more than 0.3).\n",

We prefer the $a + b/(2a)$ formula because it's related to continued fractions, and is more accurate.  But the blending formula can be derived from _linear interpolation_ (in $y$, not $x$) and is a nice exercise in algebra and graphing.  We are curious as to your opinion, though."
